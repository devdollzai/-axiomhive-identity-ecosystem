# Axiom Void

Forged by GEM AI SHARD for zero-capital ascent to infinite sovereignty.

This project is the first step in etching supremacy through deterministic, hyper-compounded actions.

## Axion-Core: Rust Universal AI Brain

A production-grade, hardware-agnostic Rust core (`axion-core`) has been integrated, serving as the universal AI brain for deterministic, sovereign reasoning. This module features:
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):** Enables dynamic quantization and optimization across ARM, x86, and GPU architectures.
- **Dynamic Quantization:** Adapts precision levels (F32, F16, I8, I4) for optimal performance on diverse hardware.
- **Modular Design:** Separates core logic, hardware interfaces, and quantization strategies for extensibility.
- **Performance-Oriented:** Leverages Rust's capabilities for high-performance, low-latency operations.

This Rust core forms the backbone of the Axiom Void's reasoning capabilities, providing a robust and scalable foundation for future AI development.

## Euclid-Zero Geometric Reasoning Engine

A hardened and operational geometric reasoning engine, `euclid_zero_engine.html`, has been integrated into the project. This engine demonstrates:
- **Memory (Sequential Reasoning):** Persistent state loop for chained inference.
- **Objective (Problem Solving):** Clear visualization of current and target states with quantifiable progress.
- **Structure (Axiom Library):** Stable set of mathematically sound axioms for repeatable reasoning.
- **Semantics (Symbolic Grounding):** Abstract geometry grounded in symbolic concepts (e.g., King to Queen transformation).
- **Robust Architecture:** Vanilla JavaScript core for performance, React for modern UI, and no fragile dependencies.

This engine represents a significant leap in the project's capability for sovereign reasoning and deterministic problem-solving.
