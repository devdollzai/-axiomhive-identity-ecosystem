# Total Victory Protocol Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Pre-Build & Pre-Commit Audit
- [ ] Set up Python linting (flake8/pylint) for backend
  - Add linting dependencies to requirements.txt
  - Create .flake8 or .pylintrc config file
  - Add lint script to package.json or Makefile
- [ ] Configure ESLint for frontend (already in package.json, ensure .eslintrc.js exists)
- [ ] Create dependency check script (check_deps.py) for Python and Node dependencies
- [ ] Implement Git integrity scan pre-commit hook
  - Check for large files (>100MB)
  - Scan for exposed secrets (API keys, passwords)
  - Verify .gitignore compliance

## Phase 2: Build & Optimization Lock
- [ ] Build monitor for Docker build
  - Wrap docker build command with timing and error tracking
  - Log build progress and identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Build monitor for Next.js build
  - Wrap npm run build with timing and error tracking
- [ ] Environment parity check script
  - Verify local Python/Node versions match production
  - Check environment variables against deployment config
- [ ] Performance bottleneck identification
  - Log top 3 slowest build steps after successful build

## Phase 3: Deployment & Verification Cascade
- [ ] Deployment gateway script
  - Check if last build is fresh (<1 hour old)
  - Verify all required env vars are set for deployment target
  - Block deployment if checks fail with [DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED]
- [ ] Live health check script
  - Post-deployment automated check hitting /api/health endpoint
  - Report [DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS] or [DEPLOYMENT FAILURE] with metrics
- [ ] Rollback protocol
  - Script to rollback to previous working version on failure
  - Provide one-click rollback command

## Integration & Testing
- [ ] Update git hooks (.git/hooks/pre-commit, pre-push)
- [ ] Update build scripts in package.json and requirements.txt
- [ ] Test all phases end-to-end
- [ ] Update README.md with new build/deploy commands
